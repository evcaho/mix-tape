# README

This is a tiny mix tape database created to learn more about Rails and ActiveRecord association using has_many through rather than belongs_to. 

Mix Tape allows you to create your own custom tape and add add songs to the tape. You can add songs that are already a part of the database, or add new songs. You can also see how many mix tapes include each song.

Eventually, the mix tape database will be searchable by artist as well and include tape limits. My ultimate goal is to include an integration with SoundCloud or Spotify. 

* Ruby version
The Mix Tape uses Ruby 2.3.0.
